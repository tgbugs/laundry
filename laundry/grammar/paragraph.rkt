;;; markup

; I think it is overall simpler to understand and implement parsing of markup
; in a second pass over blocks that have already been determined to be paragraphs
; trying to parse markup at the top level leads to a number of issues

; XXX LOL yeah newline *some text* is used all over the place and everywhere
; asterisk is pretty heavily used in here

;; sigh, again here grammar fails due to the need to match delimiters
;; the expresiveness of the ebnf is insufficient to be able to communicate
;; the fact that the starting marker must match the ending maker and then
;; just provide a list of markers, therefore we have to special case all of these

;; while it is technically possible in the elisp implementation to change markup
;; delimiters, this is something that has been ruled an implementation detail and
;; is not a feature of org, users modifying the concrete syntax are no longer using
;; org syntax but something else, therefore we do not support such functionality
;; despite the fact that in principle this could be implemented the same way as
;; runtime todo keywords are impelemented, however it adds significant complexity
;; to the tokenization step, however it may come to pass that this has to be implemented
;; in order to get correct behavior for #+options: in which case there isn't actually
;; any additional complexity since a conformant implementaiton would have to support
;; the ability to configure futher parsing in the zeroth section, however that might
;; be a second tier implementation, a first tier would only be required to handle
;; a specific set of defaults
